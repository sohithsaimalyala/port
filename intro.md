#P R O F I L E

I am a dedicated data science professional with a strong foundation in computer
science engineering and a specialization in data science. I hold a bachelor's degree
from SRM University AP, where I gained comprehensive knowledge in data analysis,
machine learning, and algorithm development. Currently, I am advancing my
expertise by pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at the University at Buffalo.
My academic background and hands-on experience equip me with the skills to solve
complex problems, leverage data-driven insights, and contribute to innovative
projects in the field of data science.

#PROJECTS

Digital Twin Driven Software defined Network for smart cities
      Developing a digital twin platform that mirrors real-world smart city infrastructure.
      Allowing for real-time data analysis, system monitoring, and simulations.
      This project aims to enhance urban management, optimize resource use, and improve
      decision-making processes through advanced networking and digital modeling
      technologies.
      
Computing with Encrypted Data possibly by Transposition Cipher
      The technique of encoding data so that it is concealed from or unavailable to
      unauthorized users is known as encryption.
      Transposition encryption is an encryption technique that makes it diï¬€icult to find
      character positions without altering actual characters
      We used Columnar Transposition Cipher to encrypt and decrypt a text between
      the Server and Client.

#Housing Price Prediction System

#Objective
This project focuses on developing a Housing Price Prediction System using machine learning and deploying it as a scalable web application. The aim is to provide a real-time tool to predict housing prices based on various features such as property size, number of rooms, and location type.

#Key Features
Data-Driven Prediction:
Uses advanced machine learning algorithms to estimate housing prices accurately.
Trained on a dataset containing detailed housing information.
Web-Based Interaction:
Built using FastAPI for the backend to serve predictions.
Includes a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time user interaction.
End-to-End Deployment:
The application is containerized using Docker for portability.
Hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., DigitalOcean, Render) for accessibility.
Modern MLOps Practices:
Integrated with MLFlow for tracking experiments and performance.
Dockerized for seamless deployment and scaling.
